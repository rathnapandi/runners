## Fit Together
*If you want to go fast, go alone ... If you want to go far, go **together**!*

### Objective

To encourage a sense of community around Axway employees by using the evergreen sport of Running, or, any physical activity for that matter.

COVID 19 is pretty well known situation that is impacting every one of our us in one way or the other. The consequences are seen in our everyday life at a personal level(Social distancing) as well as professional level (SFH). 

Our goal is encourage and re-affirm our strong sense of community within our Work family, and extended families by allowing every one of us to experience the Euphoria of Endorphins (runners high) in a virtual group setting.

* __Engage__ an active life style in a socially-acceptable, and responsible way (6 feet, 1.5 Meter apart)
* Push you to __participate__ in Axway Relay from **Sydney to Puteaux to Phoenix**
* Get you gain __Griffinpoints__ that can be re-imbursed for a whole lot of **bragging rights**!
* Allow __everyone__ to participate - *Run, Bike, Swim, Cheer* (yes! ask any Marathoner why this is important) along the way
